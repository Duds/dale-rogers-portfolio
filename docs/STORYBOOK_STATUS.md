# Storybook Implementation Status

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING

Storybook is successfully configured and building with React components.

## What's Working

### âœ… Storybook Infrastructure
- **Configuration**: `.storybook/main.ts` and `.storybook/preview.tsx` properly configured
- **Build System**: Successfully builds to `storybook-static/` directory
- **Development Server**: Runs on `http://localhost:6006/`
- **Addons**: Accessibility, themes, interactions, and essentials addons installed

### âœ… React Components with Stories
1. **Button Component** (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx`)
   - Full TypeScript interface
   - Multiple variants and sizes
   - Comprehensive stories covering all use cases
   - Accessibility features

2. **Card Component** (`src/components/ui/Card.tsx`)
   - Flexible card with title, clickable, and link support
   - Responsive design
   - Multiple content type examples
   - Custom styling support

## What's Planned

### ðŸ”„ Future React Components
The following components need React versions created to work with Storybook:

- **Icon Component**: Material Design, Carbon, Simple Icons support
- **TagList Component**: Multiple tags with selection highlighting
- **Heading Component**: Semantic heading levels H1-H6
- **FormattedDate Component**: Australian date formatting
- **Pagination Component**: Page navigation controls
- **PageHeader Component**: Page titles with metadata
- **SectionHeading Component**: Section-level headings
- **Tag Component**: Individual tag display
- **ThemeToggle Component**: Light/dark theme switching

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture
Since this is an Astro project, we're using a hybrid approach:

1. **Astro Components** (`.astro` files): Server-side rendered for the main application
2. **React Components** (`.tsx` files): Interactive components for Storybook and client-side functionality

### Adding New Components
To add a new component to Storybook:

1. Create a React version (`.tsx`) in `src/components/ui/`
2. Create comprehensive stories (`.stories.tsx`) in the same directory
3. Ensure the component follows the project's design system
4. Test accessibility and responsive behavior
5. Update this status document

## Commands

```bash
# Start Storybook development server
pnpm run storybook

# Build Storybook for production
pnpm run storybook:build

# Export Storybook as static files
pnpm run storybook:export
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test the current Button and Card components in Storybook
2. **Short-term**: Create React versions of 2-3 additional components
3. **Medium-term**: Complete all UI component React versions
4. **Long-term**: Add layout and feature component stories

## Notes

- Storybook is configured to work with React components only
- Astro components cannot be directly used in Storybook
- The build system successfully handles CSS and theme integration
- Accessibility addon is configured for WCAG compliance testing
- Theme switching works for light/dark mode testing
