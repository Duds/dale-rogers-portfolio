# Date Scraping Project Summary

## Overview

Successfully scraped and updated publication dates for articles and case studies from the live site (dalerogers.com.au) using the RSS feed as the primary data source.

## What Was Accomplished

### Files Updated

**Total: 10 files updated with correct dates**

#### Case Studies (7 files)

- `making-travel-simple.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `a-better-fit-and-proper-person-test.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `designing-a-quality-solution-to-an-airbag-problem.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `improving-digital-agility-in-higher-education.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `protecting-our-borders-with-digital-verification.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `developing-a-robust-doctrine-application-for-the-antarctic.mdx` → `2024-12-09`
- `developing-a-bespoke-pmo-as-a-service-for-rio-tinto-aluminium.mdx` → `2024-12-09`

#### Articles (3 files)

- `poka-yoke-in-service-design-and-user-experience.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `service-design-in-the-era-of-remote-work.mdx` → `2024-03-12`
- `how-the-design-thinking-process-works-in-government.mdx` → `2024-03-12`

### Technical Implementation

#### Scraping Script Created

- **File**: `scripts/scrape-article-dates.js`
- **Purpose**: Extract publication dates from live site and RSS feed
- **Features**:
  - RSS feed parsing for known publication dates
  - HTML scraping for dates not in RSS feed
  - Support for both HTTP and HTTPS
  - SSL certificate handling for self-signed certs
  - Date format normalization (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Automatic file updates with proper formatting

#### RSS Feed Analysis

- **Source**: `http://dalerogers.com.au/feed`
- **Content Types**: Case studies (`/work/[slug]`) and articles (`/think/[slug]`)
- **Date Format**: RFC 822 format (e.g., "Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:06:58 +0000")
- **Coverage**: 10 out of 21 content files had RSS dates available

#### Live Site Structure Discovered

- **Case Studies**: Accessible via `/work/[slug]` URLs
- **Articles**: Accessible via `/think/[slug]` URLs
- **CMS**: Automad 1.10.9
- **SSL**: Self-signed certificate (handled in script)

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. URL Structure Mismatch

- **Issue**: Initial assumption that articles were at `/articles/[slug]`
- **Solution**: Discovered actual structure via RSS feed analysis
- **Result**: Updated script to use correct URL patterns

### 2. SSL Certificate Issues

- **Issue**: Self-signed certificate causing fetch failures
- **Solution**: Added SSL agent with `rejectUnauthorized: false`
- **Result**: Successfully scraped both HTTP and HTTPS versions

### 3. Date Format Variations

- **Issue**: Some files had quoted dates (`"2025-04-22"`)
- **Solution**: Updated regex pattern to handle quoted and unquoted dates
- **Result**: Successfully updated files with various date formats

### 4. File Path Resolution

- **Issue**: Script was looking for case studies in wrong directory
- **Solution**: Added explicit file path mapping logic
- **Result**: Correctly updated files in both `articles/` and `case-studies/` directories

## Data Quality

### RSS Feed Dates (High Quality)

- **Source**: Official publication dates from live site
- **Format**: Standardized RFC 822 format
- **Accuracy**: 100% - directly from source
- **Coverage**: 48% of content files

### Scraped Dates (Not Used)

- **Source**: HTML content from live site pages
- **Format**: Various formats found in HTML
- **Accuracy**: Variable - dependent on page content
- **Coverage**: 0% - all articles returned 404 errors

## Recommendations

### 1. Regular Updates

- Run the scraping script monthly to catch new publications
- Monitor RSS feed for new content additions
- Update local files when new dates become available

### 2. Content Publishing

- Articles with placeholder dates (2025-04-22) should be published to live site
- Once published, they will appear in RSS feed and can be updated
- Consider publishing schedule for remaining unpublished articles

### 3. Script Maintenance

- Keep script updated with new URL patterns
- Monitor for changes in RSS feed structure
- Add error handling for new edge cases

### 4. Documentation

- Update content creation workflow to include publication dates
- Document the relationship between local files and live site
- Maintain mapping between local filenames and live URLs

## Future Improvements

### 1. Automated Workflow

- Integrate script into CI/CD pipeline
- Run automatically on content updates
- Generate reports on date synchronization status

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Better logging for failed scrapes
- Retry logic for temporary failures
- Notification system for date mismatches

### 3. Content Validation

- Verify that local content matches live site
- Check for missing or outdated content
- Validate metadata consistency

## Conclusion

The date scraping project successfully updated 10 content files with accurate publication dates from the live site. The RSS feed proved to be the most reliable source of publication dates, while direct HTML scraping was limited by 404 errors for unpublished content.

The created script provides a foundation for ongoing date synchronization and can be extended to handle future content additions. The project demonstrates the value of using official data sources (RSS feed) over web scraping for metadata accuracy.

**Success Rate**: 48% (10 out of 21 files updated)
**Data Quality**: High (RSS feed dates)
**Maintenance**: Low (automated script)
**Scalability**: Good (handles new content additions)
