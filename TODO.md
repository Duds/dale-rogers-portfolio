## Best Practices for AI Context

1. Use consistent file naming:

   - [x] Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `ContactForm.astro`)
   - [x] Utility files: camelCase (e.g., `emailUtils.ts`)
   - [x] Documentation: UPPERCASE.md

2. Add JSDoc comments for important functions:

   - [x] Document email sending functions
   - [x] Document content collection utilities
   - [x] Document more utility functions

3. Create README files in major directories:

   - [x] `/src/components/README.md`
   - [x] `/src/layouts/README.md`
   - [x] `/src/pages/README.md`

4. Use conventional commits:
   - [x] Implement commit message guidelines
   - [ ] Add commit message validation
