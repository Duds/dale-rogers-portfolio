# üìù Articles Style Guide

## 1. File Naming & Structure

- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `first-nations-led-service-design.mdx`).
- Place articles in `src/content/articles/`.
- Avoid spaces or special characters in filenames.

## 2. Frontmatter Standards

- Always include: `title`, `description`, `pubDate`, `lastModified`, `author`, `tags`, `featured`, `coverImage`.
- Use `authorBio` and `authorImage` for richer author cards.
- Use block YAML for arrays (e.g., tags).
- Dates: `DD/MM/YYYY` (Australian format) in display, ISO in frontmatter.

## 3. Component Usage

- Use custom components for structure and emphasis:
  - `CalloutBox` for info, tips, warnings, and final thoughts.
  - `QuoteBlock` for genuine, attributed quotes (with source URLs).
  - `ImageWithCaption` for all images.
  - `Card` for case studies, examples, and challenges.
  - `Icon` for visual cues (ensure icon exists in `Icon.astro`).
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup for all content.

## 4. Typography & Layout

- Use consistent font size and appearance for paragraphs, lists, and tables.
- Add vertical spacing (`<div class="mb-6"></div>`, `<div class="my-14"></div>`) between sections, intros, lists, and tables for readability.
- **When a paragraph (`<p>`) is immediately followed by a list or table, always insert `<div class="mb-6"></div>` between them for consistent vertical rhythm.**
- Use `<div class="my-14"></div>` between major sections and after key content blocks (e.g., after images, callouts, cards, or tables) to maintain clear separation and flow.
- All lists should use `class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8"` for bullet points, indentation, and spacing.
- All links should use `class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80"` for consistent styling and accessibility.
- Avoid inline utility classes in MDX unless necessary for layout.

## 5. Tables

- Use the custom `Table` component for all article tables.
- Keep tables simple, accessible, and theme-aware (light/dark support).
- Do not place tables inside Cards or Callouts; tables should be standalone elements.
- Use clear, minimal styling: plain backgrounds, bold headers, standard borders.
- Always provide a caption for accessibility and context.
- Place actionable callouts after tables when relevant.

## 6. Callouts & Quotes

- Use `CalloutBox` for summaries, info, and final thoughts. Differentiate types (`info`, `note`, `tip`, `warning`) and use custom icons where appropriate.
- Use `QuoteBlock` only for genuine, attributed quotations. Always provide a source URL.
- **Always look for genuine quotes from experts in the specific context.**

## 7. Links & References

- All links must follow the Three R's: Real, Relevant, and Reachable.
- Cite authoritative frameworks (e.g., AIATSIS, Designing with Country) when discussing cultural or ethical design tensions.
- Internal links: `/articles/slug` or `/case-studies/slug`.
- External links: `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Reference original sources for quotes, frameworks, and statistics.
- **Always look for opportunities for internal cross-links or external linked validation of concepts.**
- **Actively seek out opportunities to link to other relevant articles, case studies, or resources within the site.**
- **Where possible, add external links to authoritative sources, frameworks, or further reading.**
- **Always seek out genuine, attributed expert quotations relevant to the article's context.**

### The Three R's of Linking: Real, Relevant, and Reachable

> All links must be:
>
> - **Real:** Point to actual, existing resources (not placeholders or broken URLs)
> - **Relevant:** Directly related to the context and content in which they appear
> - **Reachable:** Working URLs that load successfully for users
>
> Validate all links during drafting and review. If a link is not real, relevant, and reachable, it must be fixed or removed before publication.

## 8. Components

- Use custom components (`ImageWithCaption`, `CalloutBox`, `QuoteBlock`, `Card`, `Table`) for all non-trivial content blocks.
- Maintain consistent vertical spacing and section flow as in the showcase articles.

## 9. Accessibility & Testing

- Test all articles for accessibility, theming, and responsiveness before publishing.
- Ensure all tables, images, and links are accessible and work in both light and dark modes.
- All images must have meaningful `alt` text.
- Use accessible colour contrast and semantic headings.
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## 10. Australian Standards

- Use Australian English spelling.
- Use metric units and $AUD for currency.
- Use Australian date and time formats.
- Reference Australian public holidays and time zones where relevant.

## 11. Content Hygiene

- Remove unused imports and classes.
- Avoid broken or split inline elements (watch for auto-formatting issues).
- Use block YAML for arrays in frontmatter.
- Add TODOs as MDX comments: `{/* TODO: ... */}`

## 12. Documentation & Changelog

- Document any new components or patterns in the project README.
- Update the changelog for major content or style changes.

### Lessons Learned

- Always check that referenced icons exist in `Icon.astro`.
- Use block YAML for arrays to avoid markdown linter errors.
- Use MDX comments, not HTML comments, for TODOs.
- Use custom components for all non-trivial content blocks.
- Add vertical spacing between sections for readability.
- Use genuine, attributed quotes with source URLs.
- Test for accessibility and theming in both light and dark modes.
- Avoid inline utility classes unless necessary for layout.
- **Always look for opportunities for internal cross-links and external validation.**
- **Always seek genuine expert quotes relevant to the article's context.**
- **Proactively seek linking and quotation opportunities during drafting and review.**

### Refactoring Workflow

1. Review frontmatter for completeness and block YAML.
2. Replace markdown-native blocks with custom components.
3. Ensure all lists and paragraphs use consistent typography.
4. Add vertical spacing between sections and lists.
5. Replace all quotes with `QuoteBlock` and provide attribution.
6. Use `CalloutBox` for info, tips, and final thoughts, with custom icons as needed.
7. Check all links, images, and icons for correctness.
8. Test for accessibility, theming, and responsiveness.
9. Add or update documentation and changelog.

- Use internal links to related articles wherever relevant (cross-linking).
- Add external links to authoritative sources or frameworks when referencing established concepts (e.g., design thinking, safety culture, ergonomics).
- Always use the correct link classes and attributes for accessibility and style.
- Use custom components (ImageWithCaption, CalloutBox, QuoteBlock, Card, Table) for all non-trivial content blocks, including for narrative, not just data.
- Maintain consistent vertical spacing and section flow as in the modernised article.
- Place actionable callouts and final thoughts at the end of major sections.
- Test all links for the Three R's: Real, Relevant, Reachable.
- Document the use of Unsplash or other open-licensed images for illustrative purposes, with meaningful alt text and captions.
