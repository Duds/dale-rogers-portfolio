# üìù Articles Style Guide

## 1. File Naming & Structure

- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `first-nations-led-service-design.mdx`).
- Place articles in `src/content/articles/`.
- Avoid spaces or special characters in filenames.

## 2. Frontmatter Standards

- Always include: `title`, `description`, `pubDate`, `lastModified`, `author`, `tags`, `featured`, `coverImage`.
- Use `authorBio` and `authorImage` for richer author cards.
- Use block YAML for arrays (e.g., tags).
- Dates: `DD/MM/YYYY` (Australian format) in display, ISO in frontmatter.

## 3. Component Usage

- Use custom components for structure and emphasis:
  - `CalloutBox` for info, tips, warnings, and final thoughts.
  - `QuoteBlock` for genuine, attributed quotes (with source URLs).
  - `ImageWithCaption` for all images.
  - `Card` for case studies, examples, and challenges.
  - `Icon` for visual cues (ensure icon exists in `Icon.astro`).
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup for all content.

## 4. Typography & Layout

- Use consistent font size and appearance for paragraphs and lists.
- Add vertical spacing (`<div class="mb-6"></div>`, `<div class="my-14"></div>`) between sections, intros, and lists for readability.
- Avoid inline utility classes in MDX unless necessary for layout.

## 5. Callouts & Quotes

- Use `CalloutBox` for summaries, info, and final thoughts. Differentiate types (`info`, `note`, `tip`, `warning`) and use custom icons where appropriate.
- Use `QuoteBlock` only for genuine, attributed quotations. Always provide a source URL.
- **Always look for genuine quotes from experts in the specific context.**

## 6. Links & References

- Use descriptive anchor text for all links.
- Internal links: `/articles/slug` or `/case-studies/slug`.
- External links: `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Reference original sources for quotes, frameworks, and statistics.
- **Always look for opportunities for internal cross-links or external linked validation of concepts.**
- **Actively seek out opportunities to link to other relevant articles, case studies, or resources within the site.**
- **Where possible, add external links to authoritative sources, frameworks, or further reading.**
- **Always seek out genuine, attributed expert quotations relevant to the article's context.**

## 7. Accessibility

- All images must have meaningful `alt` text.
- Use accessible colour contrast and semantic headings.
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## 8. Australian Standards

- Use Australian English spelling.
- Use metric units and $AUD for currency.
- Use Australian date and time formats.
- Reference Australian public holidays and time zones where relevant.

## 9. Content Hygiene

- Remove unused imports and classes.
- Avoid broken or split inline elements (watch for auto-formatting issues).
- Use block YAML for arrays in frontmatter.
- Add TODOs as MDX comments: `{/* TODO: ... */}`

## 10. Testing & Review

- Preview articles in both light and dark mode.
- Check for broken links and missing images.
- Run accessibility and performance checks.
- Ensure all custom components render as intended.

## 11. Documentation & Changelog

- Document any new components or patterns in the project README.
- Update the changelog for major content or style changes.

- Add vertical spacing between sections for readability.
- Use genuine, attributed quotes with source URLs.
- Test for accessibility and theming in both light and dark modes.
- Avoid inline utility classes unless necessary for layout.
- **Always look for opportunities for internal cross-links and external validation.**
- **Always seek genuine expert quotes relevant to the article's context.**
- **Proactively seek linking and quotation opportunities during drafting and review.**

### Refactoring Workflow

1. Review frontmatter for completeness and block YAML.
2. Replace markdown-native blocks with custom components.
3. Ensure all lists and paragraphs use consistent typography.
4. Add vertical spacing between sections and lists.
5. Replace all quotes with `QuoteBlock` and provide attribution.
6. Use `CalloutBox` for info, tips, and final thoughts, with custom icons as needed.
7. Check all links, images, and icons for correctness.
8. Test for accessibility, theming, and responsiveness.
9. Add or update documentation and changelog.
