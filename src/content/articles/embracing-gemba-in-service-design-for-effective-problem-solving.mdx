# Embracing Gemba in Service Design for Effective Problem Solving

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This article explains how the Gemba method can transform <a href="/articles/service-design-principles" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">service design</a> and <a href="/articles/problem-solving-in-practice" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">problem solving</a> in Australian organisations. You'll learn what Gemba is, how to apply it, and why it matters for building a culture of <a href="/articles/continuous-improvement-in-practice" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">continuous improvement</a>, trust, and innovation.</p>

  <p><strong>What is Gemba?</strong> <a href="https://www.lean.org/lexicon/gemba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Gemba</a> (現場) is a Japanese term meaning "the real place"—where value is created and work actually happens. In <a href="/articles/service-design-principles" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">service design</a>, it means going to the source to observe, understand, and improve processes with <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/empathy-in-design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">empathy</a> and respect.</p>

## The Gemba Method

<p>The <span title="Japanese for 'the real place'">Gemba</span> method involves observing and understanding the working environment using both facts and intuition. This systematic approach to <a href="/articles/problem-solving-in-practice" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">problem solving</a> fosters a culture of <a href="/articles/continuous-improvement-in-practice" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">continuous improvement</a> (<a href="https://www.kaizen.com/kaizen-methodology/what-is-kaizen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">kaizen</a>) and <a href="/articles/collaboration-in-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">collaboration</a>. By focusing on people, their processes, and their work, the Gemba method helps identify issues and opportunities in real time. This encourages solutions that involve those affected by the problems, making improvements more sustainable and meaningful.</p>

## Gemba Walks

<CalloutBox type="tip" class="my-10">
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A <span title="A structured visit to the place where work happens, to observe and learn">Gemba walk</span> is a core practice in <a href="https://www.lean.org/whatslean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Lean</a> and <a href="/articles/service-design-principles" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">service design</a>. It means going to the real place, seeing the real work, and talking to the real people.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<p>The Gemba walk is a vital component of the Gemba method. Rather than relying on documentation or reports, you observe work directly. While a walk may occur without the team's knowledge, engaging and enrolling people leads to deeper insights into their thoughts, feelings, and actions. This transition from passive observation to active engagement is key to building trust and uncovering real opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p>During a Gemba walk, observe the work environment and employees' interactions. Take notes on factual observations and use intuition to evaluate the situation. Maintaining a neutral stance and encouraging team members to contribute their perspectives is essential. For more on observation, see <a href="https://www.apsc.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/aps-professional-streams/hr-professional-stream/aps-hr-professional-capability-framework/observe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">APS: Observe</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Australian Example:</strong> In a recent NSW Government digital transformation project, service designers used Gemba walks to observe frontline staff at Service NSW centres. By shadowing staff and customers, the team identified bottlenecks in the check-in process and co-designed a new digital kiosk system. This led to reduced wait times and improved customer satisfaction—demonstrating the power of Gemba in an Australian public sector context.</p>
