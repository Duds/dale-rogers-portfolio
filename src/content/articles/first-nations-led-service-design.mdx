# First Nations-Led Service Design

**Embedding Cultural Safety and Self-Determination**

First Nations-led design is not an inclusion strategy. It is an act of justice.

Designing public and community services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples requires more than consultation—it requires leadership, respect, and a commitment to structural change. Cultural safety, self-determination, and respect for Country must sit at the centre of service design—not the edge.

There is no single First Nations worldview. Over 250 Nations exist across Australia, each with their own languages, laws, and ways of knowing. Design processes must recognise this diversity and begin with humility, deep listening, and cultural protocol.

## What Is First Nations-Led Design?

First Nations-led design is not a design method—it is a positioning. It shifts control and authorship from government or institutions to First Nations people themselves. It does not seek to 'include' First Nations voices in Western structures. Instead, it asks: **How must structures change to uphold First Nations ways of being, knowing, and doing?**

> **Key distinction:** _Inclusion_ asks how to fit First Nations people into existing systems. _First Nations-led design_ asks how systems must transform to reflect First Nations knowledge and priorities.

Inspired by the work of designers and scholars such as Alison Page, Sharon Finnan-White, Tyson Yunkaporta, and Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grosvenor, First Nations-led design is grounded in:

- Community governance and control
- Deep respect for Country and protocol
- Intergenerational storytelling and relationship
- Non-linearity and time-consciousness
- Healing and cultural identity as non-negotiable design values

## Core Principles

The following principles are drawn from practice across First Nations design leaders, organisations, and community-controlled services:

- **Cultural Authority:** Engage Traditional Owners and follow community protocols. Design work must be guided by those with the right to speak for Place.
- **Self-Determination:** First Nations people define the problem, set the direction, and hold decision-making power.
- **Community Control:** Design must be owned, led, and sustained by the community it serves—not outsourced.
- **Cultural Safety:** Avoiding harm is not enough. Services must affirm identity, belonging, and dignity.
- **Yarning and Storywork:** Design must create space for storytelling as truth-telling—not as extractive "user research."
- **Respect for Country and Place:** Design should reflect and honour physical and cultural landscapes, not erase them.

> "Country is more than land. It is family, law, spirit, and story." — _AIATSIS_

## Place, Story, and Design

Country is central to all First Nations cultural frameworks. Place is not a setting; it is a co-designer. Design that reflects Country may:

- Use local materials, languages, and symbols
- Respect sacred sites and cultural boundaries
- Incorporate community artwork, patterns, and motifs
- Design wayfinding and public space to reflect storylines
- Honour non-Western relationships to time and direction

Frameworks such as the **Designing with Country** protocol (Government Architect NSW) provide guidance for built environments. These should be adapted thoughtfully to digital and service contexts as well.

## Practical Considerations

### 1. **Start with Protocol**

- Identify the right people to speak for Country and culture.
- Invest time in trust-building and protocol—not just project scoping.
- Budget for Elders and cultural leaders' time, and pay appropriately.

### 2. **Shift Power**

- Use shared governance or community-controlled decision-making models.
- Fund First Nations organisations to lead design, not just participate.
- Hire First Nations designers and facilitators in leadership roles.

### 3. **Respect Time and Process**

- Allow time for collective decision-making and seasonal considerations.
- Let projects move at the pace of trust, not just deliverables.
- Embed cultural reflection and ceremony as appropriate.

### 4. **Support Belonging**

- Design with symbols, languages, and interfaces that reflect cultural identity.
- Use local dialects and visual storytelling where appropriate.
- Challenge Western norms about what is "professional" or "neutral."

### 5. **Commit to the Long Term**

- Avoid transactional or "engagement sprint" models.
- Build relationships that extend beyond the life of a project.
- Support long-term capability building in community organisations.

## First Nations Design in Action

- **First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria:** Co-designing treaty processes with full cultural authority and community governance.
- **VACCHO:** Delivering culturally safe healthcare guidance, including their Cultural Safety Training for public servants.
- **ACCHOs (Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Organisations):** Leading trauma-informed, culturally embedded health services.
- **We Al-li Healing Programs:** Culturally grounded programs combining ceremony, storytelling, and trauma healing.
- **Deadly Innovation Strategy (Queensland):** Supporting First Nations-led innovation and design capability.

## Tensions with Mainstream Design

Design practices grounded in Eurocentric systems can unintentionally reinforce colonial dynamics. Common tensions include:

| Western Design Norm | Conflict in First Nations Context |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed deadlines | May clash with seasonal rhythms and cultural ceremony |
| Extractive "user research" | Violates ownership of story and context |
| Consensus-seeking workshops | May ignore cultural hierarchies or protocol |
| Quantitative KPIs | Miss culturally meaningful indicators of success |
| Design sprints | Often too fast to allow trust, grief, or complexity |

These tensions are not resolved by tweaking tools—they require systemic rethinking.

## Challenges and Barriers

Despite growing awareness, institutional barriers remain:

- **Performative consultation** with no decision-making power
- **Short project timelines** that exclude cultural process
- **Rigid procurement** that excludes small First Nations orgs
- **Lack of cultural capability** in design and delivery teams
- **Fear of doing harm** that prevents meaningful engagement

> **Design justice** requires shared risk—not just good intent.

## For Non-Indigenous Designers and Teams

- **Learn from Indigenous voices.** Start with books like _Sand Talk_ (Tyson Yunkaporta) or _Design: Building on Country_ (Alison Page and Paul Memmott).
- **Check your role.** Are you leading, supporting, or stepping aside?
- **Avoid saviourism.** Partner with, not for, communities.
- **Challenge system constraints.** Advocate for procurement, funding, and timelines that enable self-determination.

True First Nations-led design cannot be achieved without deep structural change. It begins by listening, continues through relationship, and is sustained through shared power and cultural respect.

Design is not neutral. And healing is not optional.
