# First Nations-Led Service Design

<div class="mb-12"></div>

**Embedding Cultural Safety and Self-Determination**

<CalloutBox type="note" class="my-12">
  <p>First Nations-led design is not an inclusion strategy. It is an act of justice.</p>
</CalloutBox>

Designing public and community services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples requires more than consultation—it requires leadership, respect, and a commitment to structural change. Cultural safety, self-determination, and respect for Country must sit at the centre of service design—not the edge.

There is no single First Nations worldview. Over 250 Nations exist across Australia, each with their own languages, laws, and ways of knowing. Design processes must recognise this diversity and begin with humility, deep listening, and cultural protocol. For a deeper exploration of trauma-informed design, see <a href="/articles/considerations-for-trauma-informed-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Considerations for Trauma-Informed Design</a>.

<div class="my-14"></div>

## What Is First Nations-Led Design?

<div class="mb-8"></div>

First Nations-led design is not a design method—it is a positioning. It shifts control and authorship from government or institutions to First Nations people themselves. It does not seek to 'include' First Nations voices in Western structures. Instead, it asks: **How must structures change to uphold First Nations ways of being, knowing, and doing?**

<CalloutBox type="tip" class="my-12">
  <p><strong>Key distinction:</strong> <em>Inclusion</em> asks how to fit First Nations people into existing systems. <em>First Nations-led design</em> asks how systems must transform to reflect First Nations knowledge and priorities.</p>
</CalloutBox>

  class="my-14"
/>

Inspired by the work of designers and scholars such as Alison Page, Sharon Finnan-White, Tyson Yunkaporta, and Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grosvenor, First Nations-led design is grounded in:

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
  <li>Community governance and control</li>
  <li>Deep respect for Country and protocol</li>
  <li>Intergenerational storytelling and relationship</li>
  <li>Non-linearity and time-consciousness</li>
  <li>Healing and cultural identity as non-negotiable design values</li>
</ul>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## Core Principles

<div class="mb-8"></div>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
  <li><strong>Cultural Authority:</strong> Engage Traditional Owners and follow community protocols. Design work must be guided by those with the right to speak for Place.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> First Nations people define the problem, set the direction, and hold decision-making power.</li>
  <li><strong>Community Control:</strong> Design must be owned, led, and sustained by the community it serves—not outsourced.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Safety:</strong> Avoiding harm is not enough. Services must affirm identity, belonging, and dignity. Learn more about embedding cultural safety in <a href="/articles/considerations-for-trauma-informed-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Considerations for Trauma-Informed Design</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Yarning and Storywork:</strong> Design must create space for storytelling as truth-telling—not as extractive "user research." For more on intentional culture and design, see <a href="/articles/designing-intentional-culture" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Designing Intentional Culture</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect for Country and Place:</strong> Design should reflect and honour physical and cultural landscapes, not erase them.</li>
</ul>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## Place, Story, and Design

<div class="mb-8"></div>

Country is central to all First Nations cultural frameworks. Place is not a setting; it is a co-designer. Design that reflects Country may:

<div class="mb-6"></div>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
  <li>Use local materials, languages, and symbols</li>
  <li>Respect sacred sites and cultural boundaries</li>
  <li>Incorporate community artwork, patterns, and motifs</li>
  <li>Design wayfinding and public space to reflect storylines</li>
  <li>Honour non-Western relationships to time and direction</li>
</ul>

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-12">
  <p>Frameworks such as the <em>Designing with Country</em> protocol (<a href="https://www.governmentarchitect.nsw.gov.au/projects/designing-with-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Government Architect NSW</a>) provide guidance for built environments. These should be adapted thoughtfully to digital and service contexts as well.</p>

<CalloutBox type="warning" class="my-12">

<CalloutBox type="tip" class="my-10">
  <p><strong>Action for Designers:</strong> When working in First Nations contexts, slow down, build relationships, and seek guidance from community leaders and cultural authorities. Question whether your process, tools, and measures of success are truly fit for context.

## Challenges and Barriers

<div class="mb-8"></div>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
  <li><strong>Performative consultation</strong> with no decision-making power. For a government case study on digital verification and risk, see <a href="/case-studies/protecting-our-borders-with-digital-verification" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Protecting Our Borders with Digital Verification</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Short project timelines</strong> that exclude cultural process</li>
  <li><strong>Rigid procurement</strong> that excludes small First Nations orgs</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of cultural capability</strong> in design and delivery teams</li>
  <li><strong>Fear of doing harm</strong> that prevents meaningful engagement</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Design justice</strong> requires shared risk—not just good intent.</p>

## For Non-Indigenous Designers and Teams

<div class="mb-8"></div>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
  <li><strong>Learn from Indigenous voices.</strong> Start with books like <a href="https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/sand-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80"><em>Sand Talk</em> (Tyson Yunkaporta)</a> or <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/design-building-on-country-alison-page/book/9781742237156.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80"><em>Design: Building on Country</em> (Alison Page and Paul Memmott)</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Check your role.</strong> Are you leading, supporting, or stepping aside?</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid saviourism.</strong> Partner with, not for, communities.</li>
  <li><strong>Challenge system constraints.</strong> Advocate for procurement, funding, and timelines that enable self-determination.</li>
</ul>

  <p>True First Nations-led design cannot be achieved without deep structural change. It begins by listening, continues through relationship, and is sustained through shared power and cultural respect.</p>

Design is not neutral. And healing is not optional.
