# Considerations for Trauma-Informed Design

<div class="mb-12"></div>

Designing government and community services in Australia requires more than technical expertise—it demands empathy, cultural safety, and a deep understanding of people's lived experiences. For many Australians, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, trauma is not just personal but intergenerational and systemic. For a deeper exploration of culturally safe, First Nations-led approaches, see <a href="/articles/first-nations-led-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">First Nations-led Service Design</a>.

<CalloutBox type="info" title="What is Trauma-Informed Design?" class="my-12"><p>Trauma-informed design recognises trauma and aims to create services that do not retraumatise but instead promote dignity, healing, and trust. When applied with care, trauma-informed design principles can shape safer, more supportive, and more equitable public services. For a primer on the broader discipline, see <a href="/articles/what-is-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">What is Service Design</a>.</p></CalloutBox>

## Why Trauma-Informed Design?

<div class="mb-8"></div>

Public and community services often support people during vulnerable life moments—whether accessing healthcare, housing, education, legal support, or emergency relief. Many individuals engaging with these systems carry trauma from past experiences, including family violence, forced removal, racism, war, or institutional abuse. For examples of how service design can address complex government challenges, see <a href="/articles/five-elements-of-service-design-for-government" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Five Elements of Service Design for Government</a>.

<CalloutBox type="note" title="Note" class="my-12" icon="information-circle">
  <p>Trauma-informed design is not about delivering therapy. It's about designing environments and processes that recognise trauma and reduce harm.</p>

## Principles of Trauma-Informed Service Design

<div class="mb-8"></div>

Effective trauma-informed service design is guided by a set of interrelated principles. These support a culture of safety, empowerment, and respect across every touchpoint. For a practical look at how these principles are applied in government, see <a href="/articles/how-the-design-thinking-process-works-in-government" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">How the Design Thinking Process Works in Government</a>.

<QuoteBlock author="Australian Institute of Health and Welfare" sourceUrl="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/trauma">
  <p>“A trauma-informed approach recognises the prevalence and impact of trauma, and creates environments that are physically, psychologically and emotionally safe for both service users and staff.”</p>
</QuoteBlock>

<div class="mb-6"></div>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6"><li><strong>Safety:</strong> Prioritise physical, emotional, cultural, and psychological safety in all environments.</li><li><strong>Trustworthiness:</strong> Build trust through clear, honest, and consistent communication.</li><li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Centre people's strengths and give them genuine control over decisions.</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Engage service users, staff, and community in co-design and decision-making.</li><li><strong>Cultural Safety:</strong> Respect cultural identities and support healing from systemic trauma, especially for First Nations communities. Learn more about embedding cultural safety in <a href="/articles/first-nations-led-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">First Nations-led Service Design</a>.</li><li><strong>Peer Support:</strong> Value lived experience and enable shared recovery and connection through peer roles.</li></ul>

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-12"><p>These principles are reflected in frameworks such as the <em>Blue Knot Foundation's Trauma-Informed Practice Guidelines</em> and the <em>National Principles for Child Safe Organisations</em>, which advocate for safe, inclusive and empowering practices across systems.</p></CalloutBox>

## Practical Methods & Tools

<div class="mb-8"></div>

Trauma-informed design can be embedded at every stage of the service lifecycle. The following methods are practical ways to bring the principles to life:

<div class="mb-6"></div>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6"><li><strong>Trauma-Informed Assessment:</strong> Avoid invasive intake questions. Use opt-in storytelling and let people control how much they disclose. Ensure forms respect privacy and avoid triggering content.</li><li><strong>Environment Design:</strong> Modify spaces to feel safe and welcoming. This might include quiet zones, calming visual design, gender-neutral bathrooms, and signage that reinforces cultural respect.</li><li><strong>Staff Learning & Reflection:</strong> Move beyond one-off training. Embed reflective supervision, peer debriefing, and lived experience perspectives in everyday practice.</li><li><strong>Co-Design with Lived Experience:</strong> Compensate and support people with lived experience to contribute safely and meaningfully to the design process. For a real-world example of co-design in action, see the <a href="/case-studies/a-better-fit-and-proper-person-test" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">A Better Fit and Proper Person Test</a> case study.</li><li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Use plain English, accessible formats (audio, Easy Read, visual), and culturally appropriate messaging.</li><li><strong>Responsive Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Enable people to safely share feedback and know how it leads to real change. Close the loop with transparent reporting.</li></ul>

For example, a service might display trauma-informed posters or use the right terminology, but fail to address underlying power imbalances or consult with people who have lived experience. This can undermine trust and reinforce cynicism among both staff and service users. The <a href="https://finalreport.rcvmhs.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System</a> highlighted the risks of tokenistic engagement and the need for genuine co-design.</p></div></div></Card><Card><div class="flex items-start gap-4"><Icon name="face-frown" class="w-10 h-10 text-amber-500 flex-shrink-0 mt-1" /><div><h3 class="heading-3 mb-2">Vicarious Trauma</h3><p>Staff who regularly support people affected by trauma are at risk of vicarious trauma—emotional and psychological impacts that arise from empathetic engagement. Without adequate supervision, debriefing, and organisational support, staff may experience burnout, compassion fatigue, or secondary traumatic stress. The <a href="https://www.blueknot.org.au/resources/vicarious-trauma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Blue Knot Foundation</a> provides resources and training to help organisations support their workforce.</p></div></div></Card><Card><div class="flex items-start gap-4"><Icon name="globe-asia-australia" class="w-10 h-10 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1" /><div><h3 class="heading-3 mb-2">Cultural Blind Spots</h3><p>Services may overlook the unique impacts of colonisation, racism, or systemic violence if cultural safety is not embedded. For example, policies that do not recognise the intergenerational trauma experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples can perpetuate exclusion and harm. Genuine cultural safety requires ongoing partnership with First Nations communities and a willingness to challenge institutional biases. For a deeper exploration, see <a href="/articles/first-nations-led-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">First Nations-led Service Design</a>.</p></div></div></Card><Card><div class="flex items-start gap-4"><Icon name="currency-dollar" class="w-10 h-10 text-blue-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1" /><div><h3 class="heading-3 mb-2">Resource Gaps</h3><p>Implementing and sustaining trauma-informed design requires time, funding, and leadership commitment. Resource gaps can limit access to training, reflective practice, and co-design with people who have lived experience. Without ongoing investment, trauma-informed initiatives may lose momentum and fail to deliver lasting change. The <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/trauma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a> tracks the impact of resource constraints on mental health and trauma services.</p></div></div></Card></div>
