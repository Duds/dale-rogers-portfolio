Recently I have been noticing a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI). The designers of these AI systems use [Machine Learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) (ML) and neural networks to provide models with a lot of training data, and over time the AI observes patterns that it can use to come up with solutions to problems. I have been reading about prompt engineering, a technique where creators describe written prompts that the AI consumes and develops a response. Prompt engineering is used in [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP) and has other applications in computer vision and robotics.

## The Rise of AI-Generated Content

You may have seen prompt engineering used on social media, where fantastic images appear like an "astronaut riding a horse in a moon crater" or "the girl with the pearl earring in the style of Hiroshi Yoshida." These creations demonstrate the growing capabilities of AI in creative tasks.

Artificial Intelligence will be one of the most significant innovation challenges in the next decade. If we know that AI will change our lives, we can see that it will change consulting too. But the question is more about when AI will affect consulting. The answer is now.

## Current Applications of AI

After attending the recent EDTAS Symposium on quantum computing, I noticed side conversations about:

- AI-supported architecture
- Design automation
- Image creation and analysis
- Various other AI impacts on today's world

Tools like [CrAIyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) and [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) have caused great excitement online, with millions of amateur prompt engineers and visual poets creating engaging content.

## AI in Business Applications

Many organisations already use AI for various purposes:

- Data analysis
- Customer service automation
- Product recommendations
- Process optimization
- Contract analysis
- Operational efficiency improvements

### Real-World Example

In a previous role, I used bespoke AI software to analyse millions of property contracts, leases, licences, and deeds. The system identified risks and shortcomings in Australia's third-largest employer's estate portfolio using:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Azure Cognitive models
- Automated contract analysis

## The Journey to AI-Assisted Writing

### Discovery Process

I set myself a challenge to rewrite an archived bid in three days using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This led me to discover GPT-3, an AI model trained on vast amounts of textual content.

### Learning Through Experimentation

Initial experiments revealed:

- Longer prompts create more variable responses
- API environments aren't ideal for writing
- Need for purpose-built editing tools
- Importance of parameter control

### Finding the Right Tools

After experimentation, I discovered [chibi.ai](https://chibi.ai), which offers:

- Easy-to-use interface
- Customizable "tunings" for tone and style
- Control over content generation
- Integration with GPT-3 API

## How AI-Assisted Writing Works

The process involves:

1. Author writes initial content
2. AI completes or extends the writing
3. Machine learning model predicts likely next content
4. Author maintains control over direction and purpose

### Technical Understanding

The system works through:

- Parsing sentences into components
- Identifying relationships between parts
- Using statistical likelihood for word choice
- Learning from previous text and context

## Ethical Considerations

### Accuracy Concerns

- Potential for misinformation
- Need for human review
- Importance of fact-checking

### Authenticity Issues

- Risk of misleading content sources
- Potential for style imitation
- Intellectual property concerns

## Conclusion

AI-assisted writing is here to stay and will increasingly become part of our workflows. While it offers significant benefits, it's important to:

- Use AI as a support tool, not a replacement
- Maintain human oversight and editing
- Ensure accuracy and authenticity
- Consider ethical implications

> "We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community... Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own." - Cesar Chavez

AI writing doesn't replace good research and thinking skills; it helps with the tedious tasks of writing and editing. As consultants, we must remain factual, correct, and precise, always reviewing our work and having colleagues double-check AI-assisted content.
