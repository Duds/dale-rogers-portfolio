  <p>Culture is not an accident. It is the result of intentional design, shared values, and lived experience. For a primer on service design, see <a href="/articles/what-is-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">What is Service Design</a>.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## A diverse human

<p>First, I'll give a brief history to provide some context for my understanding of designing intentional culture. I'm an electrician; at least, I was, and, I still am. It's a part of my identity. It's not all of my identity, of course. There's the designer part, the project manager part, the part that suffers from depression, and the part that strives to be a better human.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>I learned my process control, automation and systems design skills in mining and manufacturing. I have worked for some prestigious organisations: BHP, WMC, Holden, Visy, the Royal Australian Mint, Mirvac, University of New South Wales, and the University of Canberra.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>I have always been interested in human-centred design, though I didn't call it that. I called it ergonomics and I "made it for people". I worked to ensure the shortest team member reached the pressure relief valve. The work instructions were accessible to English as a foreign language team members. And guarding was designed to make completing a task simple and effective. For more on human-centred design, see <a href="/articles/how-the-design-thinking-process-works-in-government" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">How the Design Thinking Process Works in Government</a>.</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

<p class="mb-6">This personal journey sets the stage for understanding why intentional culture is not just a theory, but a lived practice that evolves with experience.</p>

## A brief history of change

<div class="md:flex gap-8">
  <div class="md:w-1/2">
    <p>I learned quickly that innovative people would subvert poorly designed systems. I have seen hand fabricated castell (interlock) keys. Fridge magnets taped to fool reed switches. Humans are inherently ingenious. I learned that a well-designed system would enrol a person in its function, not fight to control their behaviour.</p>
    <div class="mb-6"></div>
    <p>I came through my trade in the '90s and 00's. The Howard era industrial relations reforms neutered the trade union movement, and safety culture was on the rise. The very first women were trickling into trades and engineering in the mining and manufacturing industries. I was in my late 20's before I ever met a woman in the workplace.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="md:w-1/2">
    <p>Digital computing made great strides into business, automation and process control. I took part in the transition of pneumatic automation control systems to Programmable Logic Controllers and the introduction of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. Integrated systems were increasing in complexity. I witnessed the introduction of:</p>
    <div class="mb-6"></div>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
      <li>Enterprise Resource Planning,</li>
      <li>Computerised Maintenance Management Systems,</li>
      <li>Condition Monitoring Systems,</li>
      <li>Logistics and Warehousing Systems,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and increasingly complex procedural and system integrations. The systems changed from green Wyse screens to Windows 95, and Windows NT and the cultures remained the same.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## Fear and learning

<p class="mb-6">With this context, let's look at how fear and learning influence workplace culture and the need for explicit alignment between stated and lived values.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>There was tension in those times, too, like now. Will this system take my job? Will I get the training I need? Management expects reduced Lost Time Injuries and increased Key Performance Indicators! "Safety Comes First!" But, when the line stopped, everyone knew how to act. It might not be explicit. Workers knew that you did whatever it took, safety culture be damned.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>It wasn't until insurance companies put the bite on premiums. And CEOs became accountable with jail time before the explicit and implicit biases in safety culture became aligned. Before that time, it was part of the culture for leaders to say "safety culture" and drive the opposite behaviour through an implied understanding of the accepted practices and norms. For more on safety culture, see <a href="https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/safety-topic/managing-health-and-safety/safety-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Safe Work Australia: Safety Culture</a>.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>I moved from job to job doing automation and control work, and then project management and then contract management. And I was developing this idea that in everything I did, people are at the centre. How do I make a process automation system work? I design it for people to use. How do I get a successful project across the line on time and budget? I foster relationships with people. How do I make a smooth contractual relationship? I focus on a shared understanding between people.</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## People and design

<CalloutBox type="tip" class="my-12">
  <p>People and design are inseparable. For more on the intersection of people and design, see <a href="/articles/first-nations-led-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">First Nations-Led Service Design</a> and <a href="/articles/considerations-for-trauma-informed-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Considerations for Trauma-Informed Design</a>.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<p class="mb-6">Now, let's connect the role of people in design to the broader theme of intentional culture.</p>
<QuoteBlock author="Dale Rogers">
  <p><em>Hi, my name is Dale Rogers, and I'm a service designer.</em></p>
</QuoteBlock>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>In my craft, I understand that I need to start with people and then fit all the organisational cruft around them. All the puzzle pieces in our businesses work best when they consider people first — customers, staff, suppliers, students, stakeholders, users, all people.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>And people belong to tribes. And tribes have cultures. And any organisation that thinks it can deliver anything without considering culture is dreaming. <strong>Culture eats strategy for breakfast.</strong></p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## A cultural primer

<p class="mb-6">This section defines culture and quality, and sets up the core equation for quality culture.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<CalloutBox type="highlight" class="my-12 text-2xl font-extrabold text-center">
  Quality culture = human experiences × defined culture. <br />
  <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">What is quality culture?</a>
</CalloutBox>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>And I assume that we all share a common understanding of the definition of quality. The standard of a thing as measured against the definition of a thing provides the quality of the thing. So why shouldn't quality culture be measured the same way? The standard of our culture measured against our stated cultural definition. If our norms, values and assumptions define culture, then it is through human experience and our emotions and relationships that we come to know the standard of our culture.</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## The trappings of culture

<p class="mb-6">Next, we distinguish between the visible trappings of culture and the deeper, intentional experiences that shape it.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>Ok, grand theory, but let me help you in context. What is a culture not about? Culture is not about motivational posters, foosball tables, bean bags, segues, rooftop bars, Friday afternoon drinks. These trappings of culture are not culture; they are tools and processes that create human experiences.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>Those things, the tools, the trappings of culture have importance. And like any tool, they need to be applied judiciously and designed with intent. They are used to create human experiences that drive quality culture. And the quality culture that we aspire to aligns with our business needs and values.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>Now that we understand what quality culture is and is not, I want to help you think about how you can design experiences with intent and purpose. Then you can create a culture that aligns with your business values and supports decision making for your business strategy.</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## Tools for intentional design

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-12">
  <p>Design thinking is a robust process for designing culture. For a deep dive into design thinking, see <a href="/articles/how-the-design-thinking-process-works-in-government" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">How the Design Thinking Process Works in Government</a> and <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">IDEO: What is Design Thinking?</a>.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<p class="mb-6">Here, we introduce practical frameworks for designing culture, including <span title="A process that alternates between generating many ideas (divergent) and narrowing down to the best ones (convergent)">divergent and convergent thinking</span> as part of <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">design thinking</a>.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>My preferred design-with-intent process is design thinking. It consists of a variety of tools that help you to use divergent and convergent thinking to Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver a solution. Design thinking is inherently a people-focused problem-solving process. At its heart, design thinking relies on people and is an empathetic process that creates tangible artefacts and emotional experiences.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>And, tangible artefacts and emotional experiences inherently influence culture. The use of design thinking doesn't just help you solve the problem of what your values should be. Or, how you will create a culture that aligns with those values. Its use becomes itself rituals and traditions that make desirable cultural norms, behaviours and assumptions.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>For example, research is showing that design thinking fosters the cultural values of teamwork, innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, risk-taking, boldness, and continuous improvement, among others. So, if these are the values that you aspire to, design thinking is a tool that inherently generates experiences and artefacts that support those values. There is a causality between design thinking tools and the cultures that embody these values.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>Let's get to the nuts and bolts, specifically what actions can you take to design an intentional culture? How can you be intentional, foster innovation, define your values and identify the lived experience of your culture as-is and work towards the culture you want to be. How do you make it happen? How do you get past the blockers, naysayers, the old boys club, the negative nellies and the henny pennies?</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## What needs to be true

<CalloutBox type="tip" class="my-12">
  <p>When you hit a roadblock, ask: <strong>What needs to be true?</strong> This question helps move past disagreement and towards action. For more on co-design and participatory practice, see <a href="/articles/first-nations-led-service-design" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">First Nations-Led Service Design</a>.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<p class="mb-6">When facing disagreement or inertia, asking "What needs to be true?" can unlock progress and action.</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>I have one powerful question that will get you started. This question gets you over the nitter-natter of vehement agreement past the disagreement on this or that detail. And, through the "yes, buts" of failing to act. It gets you out of the petty arguments about what our culture should look like, what are the best values; trust, no honesty, no openness!</p>
<div class="mb-6"></div>
<p>The question is "What needs to be true?" When we can't agree on what our values should be what needs to be true for us to reach an agreement. When we can't decide on what actions will best model the behaviour that supports our values, what needs to be true so that we can? When we can't afford celebration drinks for everyone and their partners, what needs to be true so that we can celebrate anyway?</p>

<div class="my-14"></div>

## Three helpful toolsets

<CalloutBox type="info" class="my-12">
  <p>Needfinding, ideation, and action are core toolsets in <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">design thinking</a>. For more on these, see <a href="/articles/how-the-design-thinking-process-works-in-government" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">How the Design Thinking Process Works in Government</a> and <a href="/articles/service-design-principles" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">The Five Key Principles of Service Design</a>.</p>

    <div>
      <strong>Needfinding:</strong> Contributes to empathy, customer focus, human-centredness, understanding and root cause analysis. Needfinding is inherently a <span title="Generating many possible ideas or explanations">divergent thinking</span> process; we ask why. Why is there a problem with our culture? Why isn't our culture aligned with our values? Why don't we trust each other? Why don't we collaborate? And on until we have collected a large sampling of information from a diverse group of people. We use a wide variety of exercises; interviews, workshops, process mapping, <span title="Prompt cards or perspective cards used to view a problem from different angles">lense cards</span> and more. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/needfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Read more about needfinding</a>

    <div>
      <strong>Ideation:</strong> Contributes to ambiguity resilience, promotes managed risk-taking, develops collaborative skills, co-design skills and cooperation skills. Ideation helps you imagine a new and different future. What might your culture look like? What sort of rituals and traditions will support the culture you want? What human experiences and tangible artefacts will drive the culture you envision. We use a wide variety of exercises. These include round-robin, opposite thinking, mash-ups, storyboarding, rip and rap and brainstorming, and there are many more. <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/ideation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Learn more about ideation</a>

    <div>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Action tools contribute to open and transparent culture, improve failure resilience, promote iterative improvement, and continuous improvement. Action tools help you create how you will change. How will you perform a ritual or tradition? How will your ritual or tradition function, and how will its purpose be known? Action tools also begin the process of closing the loop. We understand that our problem with trust is rooted in fear or shame; how will we address the fear or shame? How will we know if our rituals work? The tools we use to take action are low fidelity prototyping, storyboarding, sketching, body-storming, roleplaying, piloting and many more. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prototyping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Explore action tools</a>

</ul>

<div class="my-14"></div>

<p class="mb-6">These toolsets provide a practical foundation for designing intentional culture, moving from understanding needs to generating ideas and taking action.</p>

## Five ways to create change

<CalloutBox type="note" class="my-12">
  <p>Change is a process. For more on change and continuous improvement, see <a href="/articles/embracing-gemba-in-service-design-for-effective-problem-solving" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Embracing Gemba in Service Design</a> and <a href="/articles/poka-yoke-in-service-design-and-user-experience" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Poka-Yoke in Service Design & User Experience</a>.</p>
</CalloutBox>

<ul class="list-none pl-0 mb-8">
  <li class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-primary-green text-white text-2xl font-bold flex-shrink-0" aria-label="Step 1">1</span>
    <div>
      <strong>Understand:</strong> Understand the reality of your cultural context. This is not the values on the posters, but the truth of lived experience in your business. What are the actual norms, values and assumptions as demonstrated by behaviours? Do your colleagues shame each other in emails? Do people take calls in meetings? What are the good things? The positive experiences. Does the boss walk the floor regularly and check-in with individuals? What are the things that work, the goat tracks? Is there effective cross-functional collaboration happening informally at the coffee shop across the road?
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-primary-green text-white text-2xl font-bold flex-shrink-0" aria-label="Step 2">2</span>
    <div>
      <strong>Design:</strong> Be intentional, create artefacts and emotional experiences that promote a culture of shared values. Be explicit about what you want your culture to be and what you don't want it to be. Design connections with the values and strategies that your culture needs to support and be explicit with your team about the purpose of experiences and artefacts. Design rituals and customs that support the culture that you want. Take your cues from your understanding of what works and what doesn't. If there is more cross-functional collaboration occurring in the coffee shop, then pave that goat track. Design an intentional custom of coffee at 10 am and explicitly encourage cross-functional collaboration by including a 5-minute cross-functional presentation ritual.
      <span class="block" style="height:0.2em;"></span>
      If you create a custom in your open-plan office that after 2 pm is quiet time <em>so that</em> people can find cognitive focus, then discuss the idea openly. Discuss both the custom and the purpose of the custom, so that people know why they are being quiet in the afternoon. Test the custom, ask your team to practice the custom for a week and then evaluate its effectiveness. Did the custom help people be more focused? If not, why not? And by the way, if you create a custom with your team and reach a shared agreement, then not even the CEO gets to ignore quiet time. Sorry CEO, you can take your call outside!
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-primary-green text-white text-2xl font-bold flex-shrink-0" aria-label="Step 3">3</span>
    <div>
      <strong>Model:</strong> Prototype and co-design customs, rituals and behaviours and be explicit about your purpose. People are not mind-readers. Tell your staff "we are starting a cross-functional morning tea and we require two individuals from different departments to prepare a collaborative 5-minute presentation at each event <em>so that</em> we can demonstrate effective collaboration and model the value of cooperation in line with corporate values.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-primary-green text-white text-2xl font-bold flex-shrink-0" aria-label="Step 4">4</span>
    <div>
      <strong>Learn:</strong> Be mindful of your customs and rituals. Test them against your values. Do Friday afternoon beers engender teamwork? Maybe Friday afternoon beers deliver perverse effects. You organised Friday afternoon beers so that you could engender teamwork by celebrating the wins of the week and promoting interaction between your people. But after a review of the effectiveness, you notice that the custom deprives some members of your team, that only work four days each week, from being included.
      <span class="block" style="height:0.4em;"></span>
      This serves to entrench a culture that promotes a specific segment of your team. Your customs and rituals need to serve your values, not just the boys who stay back late Friday afternoon to create their own private culture.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start gap-4 mb-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-primary-green text-white text-2xl font-bold flex-shrink-0" aria-label="Step 5">5</span>
    <div>
      <strong>Change:</strong> Your customs, rituals and behaviours are not written in stone. If they don't serve to strengthen your culture and align with your values, then change them. Maybe your business context has changed or your strategy. Do you need to continue the weekly sales target review now that your business is changing to a retain existing customers strategy from the prior acquire new customers strategy? Maybe that sales target meeting needs to become an experience satisfaction meeting?
      <span class="block" style="height:0.4em;"></span>
      When your strategy or business context changes, revisit your customs and rituals to ensure they are supporting the culture that supports the values. If your culture no longer aligns with your values, then you need to change.
