Governments and public sector teams use the [Design Council's Double Diamond process](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/history-of-the-double-diamond/) to deliver clearer, more effective services. The process helps teams avoid jumping to solutions by first exploring the real problem space and validating options with users.

In Australia, design thinking has been used across areas like homelessness, digital identity, compliance, and licensing reform.

## What is the Double Diamond?

The Double Diamond is a visual model used to guide design thinking. It consists of four stages:

- **Discover** – understand user needs
- **Define** – frame the right problem
- **Design** – explore potential solutions
- **Deliver** – implement and improve

These stages alternate between diverging (broad exploration) and converging (focused resolution). In government, this approach supports structured innovation.

## Design thinking with constraints

Design in government is shaped by context. Common challenges include:

- **Procurement** rules delaying engagement of vendors
- **Security classifications** that restrict data access
- **Legacy systems** limiting delivery methods
- **Multiple approval layers** across departments

Good design thinking doesn't eliminate these — it helps teams work through them.

## Case study: Australia Post

<Card title="Australia Post's Digital Reinvention" class="border-l-4 border-primary-green bg-primary-green/10 dark:bg-primary-green/20 my-8">
Australia Post responded to the collapse in letter volumes by investing in digital design capability. From 2012, its Digital Division scaled from 15 to 270 people.

They embraced rapid prototyping, continuous delivery, and a user-first approach — enabling a 100× increase in annual releases and 98% cost reduction.

## Case study: Service NSW

<Card title="Service NSW: Simplifying Government" class="border-l-4 border-primary-orange bg-primary-orange/10 dark:bg-primary-orange/20 my-8">
Service NSW unified fragmented public services into one trusted experience. Their approach used end-to-end service design: from mapping complex user journeys to restructuring how departments cooperated.

Outcomes included faster licence renewals, integrated support centres, and mobile-first public portals.
