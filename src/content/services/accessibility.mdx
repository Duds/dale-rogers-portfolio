# Accessibility Audit

<UserCallout type="australian-standard">
  Ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA is mandatory for Australian Government
  websites and digital services. This audit helps meet those requirements.
</UserCallout>

Digital accessibility is about ensuring that websites, applications, and digital content can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. Our accessibility audit service provides a comprehensive evaluation of your digital products against recognized standards like WCAG 2.1, along with actionable recommendations to improve accessibility.

## Why Accessibility Matters

### Inclusion and Equal Access

Approximately 15-20% of the population has some form of disability that may affect how they use digital products. Accessibility ensures these users can:

- Navigate your site with keyboard or assistive technology
- Perceive content with screen readers or other adaptive tools
- Understand content regardless of cognitive abilities
- Interact with functionality despite motor limitations

### Legal and Business Benefits

Beyond inclusion, accessibility offers tangible benefits:

- **Legal compliance** with regulations like the Disability Discrimination Act
- **Expanded market reach** to users with disabilities
- **Improved SEO** through better semantic markup
- **Enhanced usability** for all users, including those on mobile devices or slow connections
- **Brand reputation** as an inclusive organization
