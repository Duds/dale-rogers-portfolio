# Research & Testing

<UserCallout type="tip">
  Basing decisions on evidence from real users significantly reduces project
  risk and increases the likelihood of success.
</UserCallout>

User research and testing are fundamental to creating successful products and services. We employ a wide range of methodologies to gather deep insights into user needs, behaviours, and motivations, and to rigorously test solutions throughout the design process.

## Uncovering User Needs & Behaviours

We employ a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods tailored to your specific questions. Generative research techniques like in-depth interviews and contextual inquiry help uncover unmet needs and motivations. Evaluative methods such as usability testing (moderated and unmoderated), A/B testing, and analytics reviews help validate design decisions and measure performance against key metrics.

## Actionable Insights for Better Products

Our research process is designed to deliver clear, actionable insights. We move systematically from planning and recruitment through rigorous data analysis and synthesis. Findings are presented in accessible formats, focusing on prioritized recommendations that directly inform design improvements, feature prioritization, and strategic product decisions. We ensure you have the evidence needed to build with confidence.
