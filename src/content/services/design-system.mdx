# Design System

<UserCallout type="tip">
  A well-maintained design system significantly accelerates development velocity
  and ensures a cohesive user experience across complex digital ecosystems.
</UserCallout>

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled to build any number of applications or digital experiences. More than just a UI kit or component library, a comprehensive design system includes design principles, patterns, and governance that help organizations scale design consistently across products and teams.

## Why Invest in a Design System?

Organizations with multiple digital products or complex applications face common challenges:

- Inconsistent user experiences across products
- Duplicated design and development effort
- Slow iteration and feature delivery
- Difficulty maintaining brand consistency
- Challenges scaling design across teams

A well-crafted design system addresses these challenges by creating a single source of truth for design and development teams.
