# Service Design

<UserCallout type="info">
  Service design takes a holistic view, orchestrating touchpoints, processes,
  and systems to create seamless and valuable experiences.
</UserCallout>

Service Design is the practice of designing services from the perspective of the user and the business. It involves understanding user needs, mapping journeys, identifying pain points, and co-designing solutions that deliver value across the entire service ecosystem.

<Metric value="Holistic" label="End-to-end service improvement" icon="eye" />

## Understanding the Complete Service Experience

Effective service design requires looking beyond individual touchpoints to understand the entire user journey and the underlying organisational processes that support it. We map out customer interactions, employee actions (both frontstage and backstage), and the systems involved to get a holistic view. This reveals pain points, inconsistencies, and opportunities for improvement that might otherwise remain hidden.

## Our Collaborative Design Process

Our approach is highly collaborative, bringing together users, stakeholders, and delivery teams. We use methods like journey mapping, service blueprinting, co-design workshops, and rapid prototyping to explore solutions, test assumptions, and build alignment. This ensures the final service design is not only desirable for users but also feasible and viable for the organisation to implement and sustain.
