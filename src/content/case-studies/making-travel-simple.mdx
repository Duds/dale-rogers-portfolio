## Challenge

For academics and the higher education sector, travel is a part of life. Whether performing fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, presenting research findings in Toronto, or collaborating with co-authors in Edinburgh, travel is essential for international academic engagement.

However, the existing travel system faced several challenges:

- Bureaucratic and risky processes
- Inconsistent approaches to travel management
- Limited visibility of traveller locations
- Difficulty in emergency response
- Complex expense reconciliation
- Challenges in maintaining legislative compliance

## Collaborative Solution Development

### Research and Discovery

1. **User Research**

   - Conducted extensive stakeholder interviews
   - Mapped existing processes
   - Identified pain points and opportunities

2. **Service Blueprint Creation**

   - Documented end-to-end service interactions
   - Mapped touchpoints across departments
   - Identified system integrations needed

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Created user personas
   - Established relationships between roles
   - Developed support networks

## Core Principles

Adopted three key principles inspired by ethics reform:

1. **Replace**

   - Evaluate travel necessity
   - Consider digital alternatives
   - Explore local collaboration options

2. **Reduce**

   - Optimise travel frequency
   - Combine trip purposes
   - Maximise travel efficiency

3. **Refine**
   - Enhance trip planning
   - Ensure clear benefits
   - Measure outcomes

## Implementation Process

### Ideation and Prototyping

1. **Travel Odyssey Process**

   - Generated future state concepts
   - Tested ideas with community
   - Evaluated options for:
     - Coherence
     - Confidence
     - Cost
     - Favour

2. **Prototype Development**
   - Built using Microsoft PowerApps
   - Integrated PowerAutomate workflows
   - Utilised SharePoint for data management
   - Created automated travel workflows

### Testing and Refinement

- Conducted pilot with two faculties
- Tested various travel scenarios
- Validated support processes
- Refined based on feedback

## Technical Solution

### Travel Management Platform

- Custom travel application
- Integrated booking systems
- Risk management tools
- Expense tracking
- Approval workflows

### System Integrations
