## Key Objectives

- **Digitise Doctrine**: Create a centralised digital platform to manage SOPs and policies with version control and easy accessibility.
- **Enhance Validation Processes**: Implement a closed-loop feedback mechanism to support evidence-based decision-making.
- **Design for Harsh Environments**: Ensure the platform is operable in Antarctic conditions with limited connectivity and power.
- **Prototype Integration**: Incorporate practical field applications, such as the Digital Expeditioner prototype, into the platform's framework.

## The Digital Expeditioner Prototype

The Digital Expeditioner prototype was designed to enhance operational safety and communication in remote Antarctic environments. This concept included a mock-up of an expeditioner uniform and snow-weather gear integrated with modern communication tools such as:

- **Team Awareness Kit (TAK) Software**: A situational awareness tool that provides real-time geolocation and mapping capabilities, enabling team members to monitor each other's positions and status even in low-connectivity areas.
- **Headset Radios**: Hands-free communication devices tailored for use in extreme weather conditions, ensuring clear and reliable communication during operations.

### Mesh Network Innovation

A critical feature of the Digital Expeditioner was its ability to establish a **mesh network**. By equipping each expeditioner with TAK-enabled devices, the system created a decentralised communication network where devices directly communicate with each other without relying on a central hub. This mesh network ensured continuous communication and data sharing, even when connectivity to external systems was unavailable.

The prototype also demonstrated how integrated digital tools could support the delivery and application of SOPs in the field. Expeditioners could access the latest procedures through their devices, providing a unified and accessible knowledge base to ensure consistent application of safety protocols.
