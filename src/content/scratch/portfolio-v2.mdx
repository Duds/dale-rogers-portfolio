# Portfolio Website v2

This is my new portfolio website built with Astro, React, and TailwindCSS. I wanted to create a modern, fast, and accessible website that showcases my work and skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: For static site generation and content management
- **React**: For interactive components
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Vercel**: For hosting and deployment

## Features

- Dark/light mode toggle
- Content collection for case studies, articles, and projects
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Fast page loads with minimal JavaScript
- SEO optimized

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

```
src/
├── components/  # Reusable UI components
├── content/     # Markdown content
├── layouts/     # Page layouts
├── pages/       # Astro pages
└── styles/      # Global styles
```

## Design Choices

For the design, I wanted a clean, minimalist aesthetic that puts the focus on the content. I used a limited color palette with high contrast for accessibility.

The typography is designed for readability, using a sans-serif font for headings and a serif font for body text.

## Performance

One of my key goals was performance. By using Astro's partial hydration approach, the site sends minimal JavaScript to the client, resulting in fast load times and a great user experience.

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me a lot about:

- Working with Astro's content collections
- Creating flexible layouts with TailwindCSS
- Implementing dark mode with persistent user preferences
- Optimizing images and assets for performance
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
