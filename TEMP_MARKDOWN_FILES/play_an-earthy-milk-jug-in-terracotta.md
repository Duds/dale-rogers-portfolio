This jug holds ~200ml. It was an interesting experiment using a cup template that I turned upside down. A wax resist dip keeps the bottom clear and bisque while an attempt to create a gradient of colour from sea green to pastel yellow has resulted in a dark brown streaks with sea green specks around the rim. The glaze white pearl glaze I used has reacted in an unexpected way during firing, resulting in the overall dark brown appearance. It's not quite what I expected, but I am very pleased with the dramatic result.
