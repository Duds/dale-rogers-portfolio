#  A better fit and proper person test

## Challenge

For government agencies giving permits and authorisations can be a complex process. For example, many agencies are now subject to the requirement to make a decision based on the character of a person or business and their associates. And there is no definitive standard on what constitutes a fit and proper person, with varying standards defined in legislation.

One government agency struggled with its Fit and Proper Person (FPP) research. There were significant delays while waiting for information, and much of the research required google searching (open source intelligence) and human investigative nous. They wanted to streamline their approach to FPP research and create a systematised FPP application and service that relied less on individual investigative judgement and experience and more on collaborative teamwork. The agency wanted to reduce the risks that their FPP research might miss something in an entity's dynamic and changing relationships.

## Outcomes

The Entity Active Management (EAM) project was delivered against a tight timeframe of two sprints of three weeks each to meet DAWE's requirements. The project was delivered on time, within budget, and successfully implemented. The project required me to work closely to develop service designs and system configurations that met the client's requirements.

My involvement in the project enabled the client to fast-track the project delivery. I provided service design expertise to produce detailed user stories, service blueprints and platform architecture designs that enabled the development team to hit the ground running with a robust platform design requirements backlog. My stakeholder engagement capability enabled me to develop detailed service designs and system configurations that met the stakeholders' needs.

The project also enabled the client to identify areas of the platform that other business units could use. This enabled enterprise scale cost reductions.

The EAM platform was successfully developed on Dynamics 365, utilises Azure PaaS services and has implemented Azure cognitive services, Azure machine learning, and SQL analytics services. The platform monitors governed entity relationships, financial, governance and media notifications in near real-time. It uses AI to help improve entity active management decisions for relevant entities and their related events. This allows the system to identify high-risk entities that require increased monitoring and management and provide insights into why specific changes occur so that corrective actions can be taken to minimise the risks of entities with links to crime or pheonixing being able to conduct import or export activities.
