### Introduction

To secure the contract, I crafted a speculative design that illustrated our understanding of Rio Tinto Aluminium’s needs and our ability to deliver a bespoke solution.

### Key Objectives

  * **Speculative Design for Success:** Create compelling personas, user journeys, and service blueprints tailored to Rio Tinto Aluminium’s requirements.
  * **Showcase Expertise:** Demonstrate ICT service design capabilities to position us as the ideal partner.
  * **Achieve Seamless Integration:** Design a PMO solution that aligned with existing workflows and improved operational efficiency.

### Service Design Framework

#### Customer Personas

Drawing from my mining industry experience, I identified key stakeholders within Rio Tinto Aluminium, such as project managers overseeing large-scale site operations and ICT staff managing infrastructure in remote locations, ensuring the service design addressed their specific roles and challenges. Personas included project managers, operational leads, and ICT staff, each with distinct needs and pain points.

#### User Journeys

I mapped out user journeys to depict how Rio Tinto Aluminium teams would interact with the PMO service. These journeys highlighted touchpoints and pain points, ensuring the solution provided a seamless experience that integrated into their workflows. Additionally, I incorporated a detailed understanding of Atturra's various business units, ensuring that the PMO service effectively contract-managed and facilitated transparent revenue sharing across resources providing services to RTA. This alignment allowed for efficient utilisation of resources and maximised value delivery to the client.

#### Service Blueprints

A comprehensive service blueprint illustrated the end-to-end PMO service delivery process, detailing key elements such as a centralised project tracking system to monitor progress across multiple sites, a resource allocation framework to optimise team deployments and minimise downtime, and a contract management structure that facilitated transparent revenue sharing among Atturra's business units. This blueprint served as a visual guide for both the client and our team, ensuring clear accountability and alignment across every stage from implementation to operation.

### Implementation

#### Agile Methodology

An agile approach ensured continuous improvement through iterative cycles. Feedback from Rio Tinto Aluminium informed refinements, aligning the service closely with their evolving needs.

#### User Acceptance Criteria

Clear user acceptance criteria were defined, establishing measurable benchmarks to evaluate the success of the PMO service. These benchmarks ensured transparency and alignment with client expectations.

### Outcome

#### Successful Bid and Contract Award

The speculative design was instrumental in securing the contract by showcasing detailed user personas, comprehensive user journeys, and a service blueprint that aligned closely with Rio Tinto Aluminium’s operational challenges and goals. It demonstrated our understanding of Rio Tinto Aluminium’s challenges and showcased our ability to deliver a tailored Managed PMO as a Service, while also leveraging our operations to provide competitive resources for a variety of ICT projects across RTA businesses.

#### Enhanced Operational Efficiency

Post-implementation, the PMO service improved operational efficiency at Rio Tinto Aluminium. Projects progressed smoothly under enhanced oversight, with streamlined processes and better coordination.

### Importance

This project underscored:

  * **The Power of Speculative Design:** Strengthening bids by aligning solutions with client-specific challenges.
  * **Tailored Solutions:** The value of designing services that address unique operational contexts.
  * **Agility in Service Delivery:** The effectiveness of iterative development based on client feedback.

#### Conclusion

The PMO as a Service initiative for Rio Tinto Aluminium exemplifies our commitment to innovative and tailored service design. By addressing specific industry challenges and showcasing our expertise, we secured a successful bid and contributed to the client’s operational excellence. This project sets a benchmark for future initiatives, reaffirming our ability to deliver value through customised solutions.
