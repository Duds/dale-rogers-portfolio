Want to take a look under the hood of this website? Wonder no more!

### Hosting

This site is hosted by [CrazyDomains](https://www.crazydomains.com.au/) using an economy Linux hosting package. I am using [PHP7.3](https://www.php.net/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

### Content Management System (CMS)

I thought that WordPress was a bit of overkill for my humble portfolio website. So I decided to use [Automad](https://automad.org/), a free and open-source software application under an [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Automad is a flat content management and templating system written in PHP.

### Web analytics

I use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/) to check if my mum has visited the site lately.

### Design tools

I swapped out the Adobe Creative Suite two years ago because I wasn't happy with the continuous and ongoing subscription fees. I now use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) for all my image editing needs. I'm also a big fan of [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) when creating design artefacts. Finally, I must attribute [the noun project](https://thenounproject.com/); it is a never-ending source of inspiration and procrastination.

### Homepage animation

The homepage animation is written in [P5.js](/colophon/p5js.org), and its concept is a colourful animated particle system. It creates a canvas on the page and then generates four arrays of particles with different colours. Each particle is randomly placed on the canvas and has a specific size and transparency based on its position in the arrays. The particles then move in random directions, determined by the noise function. Their movement is updated in the "draw" function, which displays them on the canvas as circles with their specific colour, size, and transparency.

In short, this script creates a visual representation of animated particles with different colors, sizes, and transparencies that move randomly on the canvas. The movement of the particles is determined by random values generated by the noise function, giving the animation a chaotic and organic feel.
