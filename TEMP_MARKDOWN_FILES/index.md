## My expertise

### Strategy & service design

As a creative and pragmatic thinker, I bridge the gap between business and design. My strengths lie in supporting organisations to make evidence-based decisions, from strategy to implementation.

## My work

### Creating services that matter

I create products, services and strategies that offer meaning at a human scale. The services I create consider the needs of the people that use them and deliver better experiences and relationships.
