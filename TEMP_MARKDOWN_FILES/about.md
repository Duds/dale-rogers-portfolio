#  About me   
  
I'm a dreamer, designer, tinkerer and doer. I fell in love with service and strategic design because it is the place, I can create impact.

I dig into an idea to determine what is authentic, human, and relevant. Then I use all the tools of tech and design to bring it to life. To create a solution and design that is tangible, experiential, supportive and sustainable.

## I'm in Canberra, Australia

But I'm not constrained by geography or time zones. Collaboration is key! I've helped organisations in Australia, and the US use the power of design to create a positive social impact with technology - [so get in touch!](/act)

## What I care about

### Collaboration builds quality

Every day, I practice genuine collaboration—building on one another’s concepts and sketches until it’s impossible to say where the idea came from in the first place.

### Push a little further

I constantly push boundaries, challenge standards, and redefine what’s possible. Yes, that makes my job a lot of work—but it’s also what makes it so worthwhile.

### Be good to work with

Be nice. Be optimistic. Be supportive. Treat tough problems as interesting challenges. Be critical, not cynical. That’s the attitude I bring to my work every day.

### Details make the difference

I care about all the little things—the stuff no one else will notice—because that meticulous commitment to excellence is exactly what sets me apart.

### Work with only the brightest

In my collaborators, partners, and clients, I seek out people who take pride in their work and genuinely excel at it.

### Always get it done

When I say I’ll deliver, I do. When Plan A doesn’t work, I don’t make excuses I start executing Plan B. You won’t see me in a suit very often, but my work ethic is 100% professional.
