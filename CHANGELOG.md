## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-19

- Refactored all CSS to remove custom classes from @apply and enforce token-based utility usage throughout the codebase
- Updated all documentation to clarify that contributors must directly update docs (README, changelog, code comments, etc.) as part of any change
- Enforced token-based styling for all colours, spacing, radii, and other design values; Tailwind colour-numbered classes (e.g. -500) are no longer used
